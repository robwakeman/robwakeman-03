# robwakeman-03

Rebuild of [personal site](https://www.robwakeman.com/) in Gatsby

Hosted at Netlify

## TODO

- Add more content
- Add more notes

## Reasons for rebuild

- Needs a refresh
- Opportunity to use a static site generator
- Opportunity to learn Gatsby
- More performant
- More secure
- Easier to maintain
- Opportunity to rethink content

## Notes

### Project pages

Project content from Markdown files.

Project pages dynamically created with `createPages`

Project paths are set in frontmatter e.g.

`path: "/projects/otter"`

This is instead of creating the page slugs programatically.
