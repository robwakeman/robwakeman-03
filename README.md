# robwakeman-03

Rebuild of personal site in Gatsby (work in progress).

[Demo](http://dev.robwakeman.com/robwakeman-03/)  
Home page works, but internal paths need adjusting to work in subdomain.

[Existing site](https://www.robwakeman.com/) (built with WordPress/Foundation)

## TODO

Complete the build

Fix internal paths to allow demo site to work on subdomain

Deploy (possibly Netlify)

## Reasons for rebuild

- Needs a refresh
- Opportunity to use a static site generator
- Opportunity to learn Gatsby
- More performant
- More secure
- Easier to maintain
- Opportunity to rethink content
