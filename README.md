# robwakeman-03

Rebuild of personal site in Gatsby  
(work in progress).

[Demo](http://dev.robwakeman.com/robwakeman-03/)

[Existing site](https://www.robwakeman.com/)  
(WordPress/Foundation)

## TODO

- Add more content
- Add contact form
- Sort CSS structure in layout.module.scss
- Deploy (possibly Netlify)

## Reasons for rebuild

- Needs a refresh
- Opportunity to use a static site generator
- Opportunity to learn Gatsby
- More performant
- More secure
- Easier to maintain
- Opportunity to rethink content

## Notes

### Project pages

Project content from Markdown files.

Project pages dynamically created with `createPages`

Project paths are set in frontmatter e.g.

`path: "/projects/otter"`

This is instead of creating the page slugs programatically.
