    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm Rob, a front-end developer based in London</p>
    <p>
      From a background in the music industry, including a few years as a
      professional musician, I transitioned into front-end web development
      through self-learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      With over 10 years commercial experience, I have created websites for
      clients such as Tate, Central Saint Martins â€“ UAL and Norwich University
      of the Arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On some projects I work alongside a designer - whatever it takes to solve
      problems that meet both business and user needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      For clients I deliver high quality work on time with excellent
      communication throughout the project lifecycle.
    </p>
    <p>And I offer ongoing support and guidance after sign off.</p>
