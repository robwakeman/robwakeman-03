# robwakeman-03

Rebuild of personal site in Gatsby (work in progress).

[Demo](http://dev.robwakeman.com/robwakeman-03/)  
Issues to resolve - see below

[Existing site](https://www.robwakeman.com/) (built with WordPress/Foundation)

## TODO

- Fix issues

  - Fix images - gatsby-image is currently only rendering the blur-up effect (whether I use prefixPaths in build or not)

  - Fix menu - it works on localhost, not on demo site (whether I use prefixPaths in build or not)

Attempted solutions:  
gatbsy build
gatsby gatsby build --prefix-paths
gatsby clean

--

Complete the build

Deploy (possibly Netlify)

## Reasons for rebuild

- Needs a refresh
- Opportunity to use a static site generator
- Opportunity to learn Gatsby
- More performant
- More secure
- Easier to maintain
- Opportunity to rethink content
